    "# What is programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feel free to [skip this part](#how-to-read-this-tutorial) if you\n",
    "already know everything it's talking about.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a computer user you know that computers don't have feelings. They\n",
    "don't work any faster or slower depending on if we're angry at them or\n",
    "if we're happy. Computers can perform millions of calculations per\n",
    "second, but they require us to tell them exactly what to do. If they do\n",
    "something else than we want them to do the problem is usually that they\n",
    "don't understand our instructions the way we understand them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only big difference between programming and what you're familiar\n",
    "with already is that instead of clicking buttons to do things we write\n",
    "the instructions using a **programming language**. Most programming\n",
    "languages consist of English words, digits and some characters that have\n",
    "special meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike people often think, programming is usually not complicated. Large\n",
    "programs are always made of **small, simple pieces**, and those pieces\n",
    "are written one by one. Programming languages are made to be used by\n",
    "humans, so if there's an easy way to do something and a difficult way to\n",
    "do something, you should use the easier way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do I need?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, **you don't need to be good at math**. Some programmers\n",
    "are good at math, some are not. Programming and math are two separate\n",
    "things and being good or bad at one doesn't mean you are automatically\n",
    "good or bad at the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also don't need a powerful computer. I could do almost all of my\n",
    "programming on a 12-year-old computer if I needed to. Fast computers are\n",
    "nice to work with, but you don't need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming takes time like all hobbies do. Some people learn it\n",
    "quickly, and some people don't. I don't expect you to read this tutorial\n",
    "in a couple hours and then master everything it's talking about. Take\n",
    "your time with things, and remember that I learned to program slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses a programming language called Python because it's\n",
    "easy to learn and we can do many different things with it. For example,\n",
    "we can create our own applications that have buttons that people can\n",
    "click instead of just using applications written by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can get started with Python we need to know how to write some of\n",
    "Python's special characters with our keyboards. Unfortunately I don't know\n",
    "which keys you need to press to produce these characters because your keyboard\n",
    "is probably different than mine. But the keyboard can tell what you\n",
    "need to press. For example, my Finnish keyboard has a key like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A key on my keyboard.](../images/key.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the characters on this key mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I can type a number 7 by pressing this key without holding down other keys\n",
    "    at the same time.\n",
    "- I can type a `/` character by holding down the shift key (on the left edge\n",
    "    of the keyboard, between Ctrl and CapsLock) and pressing this key.\n",
    "- I can type a `{` character by holding down AltGr (on the bottom of the\n",
    "    keyboard, on the right side of the spacebar) and pressing this key.\n",
    "    Holding down Ctrl and Alt instead of AltGr may also work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only key that doesn't have anything written on it is spacebar. It's the\n",
    "big, wide key that's closest to you. Another key that's used for producing\n",
    "whitespace is tab, the key above CapsLock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we need to know how to type these characters. We'll learn\n",
    "their meanings later.\n",

    "\n",

    "people have commented on this and helped me improve this a lot also. But what\n",
    "should you do if you have a problem with the tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try the example code yourself.\n",
    "2. Read the code and the explanation for it again.\n",
    "3. If there's something you haven't seen before in the tutorial and it's\n",
    "    not explained, try to find it in the previous chapters.\n",
    "4. If you can't find what you're looking for or you still have trouble\n",
    "   understanding the tutorial or any other problems with the tutorial,\n",
    "   please [tell me about it](../contact-me.md). I want to improve this\n",
    "   tutorial so other readers won't have the same problem as you have.\n",
    "5. See [Getting help](../getting-help.md) if you can't contact me for some\n",
    "    reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to combine this tutorial with other learning resources. If this\n",
    "tutorial isn't exactly what you're looking for you don't need to stick with\n",
    "nothing but this. You can find another tutorial and mix the tutorials however\n",
    "you want as long as you **make sure that you understand everything you read**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important things with learning to program is to **not\n",
    "fear mistakes**. If you make a mistake, your computer will not break in\n",
    "any way. You'll get an error message that tells you what's wrong and\n",
    "where. Even professional programmers do mistakes and get error messages\n",
    "all the time, and there's nothing wrong with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know what some piece of code in this tutorial does just\n",
    "**try it and see**. It's practically impossible to break anything\n",
    "accidentally with the things you will learn by reading this tutorial,\n",
    "so you are free to try out all the examples however you want and change\n",
    "them to do whatever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though a good tutorial is an important part about learning to\n",
    "program, you also need to learn to make your own things. Use what you\n",
    "have learned, and create something with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But reading is boring!\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is probably the most boring chapter in the whole tutorial.\n",
    "Other chapters contain much less text and much more code. You can also\n",
    "get pretty far by just reading the code, and then reading the text only\n",
    "if you don't understand the code.\n",

    "## Summary\n",

    "- Now you should know what programming and programming languages are.\n",
    "- You don't need to be good at math and you don't need a new computer.\n",
    "- Complicated programs consist of simple pieces.\n",
    "- You don't need to remember how to type different characters. Just find the\n",
    "    character on your keyboard and press the key, holding down shift or AltGr\n",
    "    as needed.\n",
    "- Make sure you understand everything you read.\n",
    "- Experiment with things freely and don't fear mistakes.\n",
    "- Error messages are our friends.\n",
